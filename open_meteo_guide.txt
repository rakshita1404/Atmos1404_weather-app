GUIDE: HOW TO EXPLORE OPEN-METEO API YOURSELF

Follow these steps to generate your own API links and see how they work.

-------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: THE WEATHER FORECAST API
-------------------------------------------------------
1.  **Visit the Website:**
    Go to: https://open-meteo.com/

2.  **Scroll to "Weather Forecast":**
    You will see a form with a map and check boxes.

3.  **Select Location:**
    - It might auto-detect your location.
    - Or you can search for a city (e.g., "Berlin") in the search bar on the map.

4.  **Choose Your Variables:**
    - Scroll down to "Hourly Weather Variables" or "Current Weather Variables".
    - Check the boxes for data you want (e.g., "Temperature (2 m)", "Wind Speed (10 m)").
    - *Tip:* For our project, we mostly used "Current Weather" options.

5.  **Generate the URL:**
    - Scroll down to the bottom of the section.
    - You will see a box labeled "API URL".
    - It looks like: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=52.52&longitude=13.41&current=temperature_2m,wind_speed_10m`
    - **Click on this link.** It will open a new tab showing the raw JSON data. This is exactly what our JavaScript code reads!

-------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: THE GEOCODING API (Finding Cities)
-------------------------------------------------------
1.  **Go to the Docs:**
    On the top menu bar, click **"Developers"** -> **"Geocoding API"**.
    Or go directly to: https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api

2.  **Try the Demo:**
    - You will see a "API Response" demo box.
    - You can type a city name in the "Name" field (e.g., "New York").

3.  **See the Result:**
    - The URL will update instantly below: `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=New+York&count=10...`
    - Click it to see the list of cities found with their latitude and longitude.

-------------------------------------------------------
PRACTICE TASK
-------------------------------------------------------
Try to make a URL that gets the weather for "Tokyo".
1. Note Tokyo's Lat/Lon (35.6895, 139.6917).
2. Go to the main page.
3. Enter those coordinates manually or search "Tokyo".
4. Check "Temperature" and "Rain".
5. Click the generated API URL and see if it says it is raining!
